# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security implementation for LifeNavigator, including field-level encryption, cross-service communication, and API gateway security.

## Field-Level Encryption

We've implemented field-level encryption using AES-256-GCM to protect sensitive data. This implementation includes:

### Core Components:

1. **Encryption Utilities** (`src/lib/encryption/index.ts`):
   - AES-256-GCM encryption with authentication tags
   - Secure key derivation from environment variables
   - Envelope encryption pattern for data encryption keys

2. **Prisma Middleware** (`src/lib/encryption/prisma-middleware.ts`):
   - Automatic encryption/decryption of sensitive fields
   - Model-specific field encryption configuration
   - Transparent handling for create/update/read operations

3. **Model Encryption Utilities** (`src/lib/encryption/model-encryption.ts`):
   - Helpers for encrypting/decrypting TypeScript models
   - JSON handling for complex data structures
   - Context binding to prevent data tampering

### Implementation in Services:

Field-level encryption has been applied to:
- Health records: medical data, allergies, medications
- Financial records: account numbers, investment notes
- Authentication: OAuth tokens, session data

## Cross-Service Communication Security

Secure communication between services is crucial for the application's security. We've implemented:

### Client-Side:

1. **Secure Service Client** (`src/lib/api/secure-service-client.ts`):
   - Request signing with HMAC-SHA256
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Timeout handling and error normalization
   - Unique request IDs for tracking

2. **Backend Service Configuration** (`src/lib/api/backend-services.ts`):
   - Environment-specific service endpoints
   - API key management
   - Service client factory with proper authentication

### Server-Side:

1. **Cross-Service Authentication** (`src/lib/middleware/cross-service-auth.ts`):
   - Request signature verification
   - Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
   - Service identification and authorization
   - API key validation

2. **Example Implementation** (`src/app/api/internal/health-check/route.ts`):
   - Demonstration of secure service endpoint
   - Authentication and authorization checks
   - Proper error handling

## API Gateway & CORS Security

We've simplified the implementation of API gateway and CORS security in the application to avoid dependency issues:

### CORS Configuration:

CORS headers are now configured in `next.config.js` to provide:
- Configurable allowed origins through environment variables
- Standard allowed methods and headers
- Support for credentials when needed

```javascript
// next.config.js
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/(.*)',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin',
          value: process.env.CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS || '*',
        },
        {
          key: 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods',
          value: 'GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS,PATCH',
        },
        // ... other headers
      ],
    },
  ];
}
```

### API Security Headers:

We've also added essential security headers to API routes:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

### Implementation Guide:

For a more advanced implementation of API gateway security with rate limiting, IP filtering, and advanced CORS, refer to the complete designs in:
- `src/lib/middleware/cors-config.ts`
- `src/lib/middleware/api-gateway.ts`

These can be gradually implemented as the application's dependencies are stabilized.

## Security Best Practices

Throughout the implementation, we've followed these security best practices:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security at different levels
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Services only have access to what they need
3. **Secure by Default**: Security enabled without explicit configuration
4. **Environment Isolation**: Different security configurations for dev/staging/prod
5. **Secure Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive information
6. **Error Handling**: Avoid leaking implementation details in errors

## Configuration

Security features are configured through environment variables:

```
# Encryption
ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=your-master-key
ENCRYPTION_SALT=your-salt
ENABLE_FIELD_ENCRYPTION=true

# Cross-Service Communication
INTERNAL_API_KEY=your-internal-api-key
FINANCIAL_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
FINANCIAL_API_KEY=your-financial-api-key

# CORS & API Gateway
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com,https://admin.example.com
ADMIN_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://admin.example.com
API_LOGGING=true
```

## Phased Implementation

To avoid integration issues, we recommend a phased approach to security implementation:

1. **Phase 1**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data
2. **Phase 2**: Cross-service authentication
3. **Phase 3**: Basic CORS and security headers (implemented in next.config.js)
4. **Phase 4**: Full API gateway with rate limiting and IP filtering
