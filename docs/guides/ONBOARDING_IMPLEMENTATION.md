# LifeNavigator Onboarding & Profile Management Implementation

## Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive onboarding flow with data capture, document upload, and profile editing functionality for the LifeNavigator freemium application.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Onboarding Flow
- **Multi-step onboarding process** with 9 steps:
  - Welcome screen
  - Personal information collection
  - Financial profile
  - Health profile  
  - Career profile
  - Education profile
  - Document uploads
  - Tier selection (Free/Pilot/Pro)
  - Completion confirmation

- **Progress tracking** with visual indicators
- **Data persistence** - users can leave and return without losing progress
- **Skip functionality** - optional sections can be skipped
- **Form validation** with error handling

### 2. Database Schema
Created comprehensive tables for data storage:

- `user_profiles` - Extended user profile information
- `user_documents` - Document metadata and storage paths
- `onboarding_progress` - Tracks onboarding completion status
- `user_collected_data` - Flexible data storage for all user inputs
- `feature_usage` - Tracks freemium feature usage and limits
- `onboarding_templates` - Configurable onboarding fields

### 3. Document Upload System
- **Secure file uploads** to Supabase Storage
- **File validation** (type, size limits)
- **Freemium restrictions** - 10 documents/month for free tier
- **Document categorization** (Financial, Tax, Medical, etc.)
- **Processing status tracking**

### 4. API Routes

#### Onboarding APIs:
- `POST /api/v1/onboarding/progress` - Save progress for each step
- `GET /api/v1/onboarding/progress` - Load saved progress
- `POST /api/v1/onboarding/complete` - Complete onboarding and save all data

#### Document APIs:
- `POST /api/v1/documents/upload` - Upload documents with metadata
- `GET /api/v1/documents/upload` - List user's documents with pagination

#### Profile APIs:
- `GET /api/v1/profile` - Get complete user profile
- `PUT /api/v1/profile` - Update user profile

#### Feature Access API:
- `GET /api/v1/features/access` - Check feature access based on tier

### 5. Profile Editing
- **Comprehensive edit page** at `/dashboard/settings/profile/edit`
- **All profile sections editable**:
  - Personal information
  - Financial profile
  - Health information
  - Career details
  - Education background
- **Real-time validation**
- **Success notifications**
- **Profile completion tracking**

### 6. Freemium Feature Restrictions

Implemented tier-based access control:

**Free Tier:**
- 5 manual accounts/month
- 10 document uploads/month
- Basic insights only
- Community support

**Pilot Program (Limited Time):**
- Everything in Free tier
- Bank connections via Plaid
- AI-powered insights
- Priority feedback channel
- Unlimited documents

**Pro Tier ($19.99/mo):**
- Everything in Pilot
- Healthcare integrations
- Advanced analytics
- API access
- Priority support

### 7. Storage Configuration
Created Supabase storage buckets:
- `user-documents` - Private bucket for document storage
- `profile-images` - Public bucket for avatars

With appropriate RLS policies for security.

## Data Flow

1. **New User Registration** → Redirected to `/onboarding`
2. **Multi-step Data Collection** → Progress saved at each step
3. **Document Uploads** → Stored in Supabase Storage
4. **Tier Selection** → Determines feature access
5. **Completion** → All data saved, user marked as onboarded
6. **Dashboard Access** → Profile data available throughout app
7. **Profile Editing** → Users can update info anytime

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- File upload validation and sanitization
- Feature usage tracking prevents abuse
- Audit logging for data changes

## Usage Tracking

The system tracks:
- Feature usage against monthly limits
- Document upload counts
- Profile completion percentage
- Onboarding step completion

## Next Steps

1. **Email Verification** - Implement email verification flow
2. **Payment Integration** - Connect Stripe for Pro tier
3. **Document Processing** - OCR and data extraction from uploads
4. **Advanced Analytics** - Usage dashboards for users
5. **Mobile Optimization** - Enhance mobile experience

## Testing the Implementation

1. Create a new account or use existing
2. Navigate to `/onboarding` if not completed
3. Fill out each step (can skip optional ones)
4. Upload test documents in the documents step
5. Select a tier (Free tier implemented)
6. Complete onboarding
7. Visit `/dashboard/settings/profile/edit` to edit profile
8. Check feature limits at `/api/v1/features/access`

The implementation provides a smooth, professional onboarding experience that captures comprehensive user data while respecting freemium limitations.
