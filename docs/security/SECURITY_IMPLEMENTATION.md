# LifeNavigator Security Implementation

This document outlines the security features implemented in the LifeNavigator application and provides guidance for deploying to AWS with enhanced security.

## Implemented Security Features

### Authentication Security

1. **Password Management**
   - Password reset functionality with secure tokens
   - Rate limiting for password operations
   - Strong password validation (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special)

2. **Enhanced Token Security**
   - JWT token rotation (2-hour rotation window)
   - Token revocation capability
   - Maximum session duration enforcement (14 hours)
   - Session invalidation on logout
   - Prevention of token reuse through JTI tracking

3. **Cookie Security**
   - Secure cookie configuration (HTTP-Only, Secure, SameSite)
   - Cookie domain controls
   - Session expiration alignment with token rotation

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - TOTP-based MFA (Time-based One-Time Password) 
   - MFA token verification and validation
   - Integration with authentication flow

5. **Account Protection**
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Progressive rate limiting
   - IP tracking for suspicious activity

6. **CSRF Protection**
   - Double-submit cookie pattern implementation
   - CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
   - Strict SameSite cookie policy

7. **Security Audit Logging**
   - Comprehensive security event tracking
   - Login, logout, and security event auditing
   - Device tracking and fingerprinting

### Database Security

1. **PostgreSQL Migration**
   - Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL
   - Connection pooling configuration
   - Optimized DB indexes for performance
   - Backup and restore procedures

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypted sensitive fields using AES-256-GCM
   - Secured document storage
   - Token encryption

### API Security

1. **API Gateway Security**
   - Endpoint-specific rate limiting
   - Request validation and sanitization
   - Security headers configuration
   - IP filtering capabilities

2. **Cross-Service Authentication**
   - Secure service-to-service communication
   - Request signing with HMAC
   - Service identification and validation

## AWS Production Serverless Architecture

The planned AWS serverless architecture includes:

1. **API Gateway**
   - REST API with domain-based routing
   - WAF integration for security
   - Authorization with AWS Cognito
   - Custom authorizers for fine-grained access control
   - Rate limiting and throttling

2. **Lambda Functions**
   - Domain-specific Lambda functions
   - Containerized for consistency
   - Cold start optimization
   - Memory optimization

3. **Authentication**
   - Cognito User Pools integration
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Token management and validation
   - Social identity provider integration

4. **Database**
   - Aurora Serverless v2 (PostgreSQL)
   - Connection pooling for Lambda
   - Multi-AZ deployment
   - Encryption at rest

5. **Frontend Delivery**
   - CloudFront distribution for static assets
   - Edge caching for performance
   - S3 bucket for static content storage
   - HTTPS enforcement

6. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - CloudWatch dashboards and metrics
   - X-Ray tracing for request paths
   - Custom security metrics
   - Alerting for security events

## Security Best Practices

1. **Secret Management**
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager for all secrets
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Scope permissions per service

2. **Access Control**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Implement fine-grained IAM policies
   - Use role-based access control

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement field-level encryption for PII
   - Set up data retention policies

4. **Network Security**
   - Place Lambda functions in private subnets
   - Configure security groups for minimal access
   - Use WAF for API protection

5. **Monitoring & Incident Response**
   - Set up alerts for security events
   - Configure audit logging
   - Create incident response procedures

## Deployment Instructions

For deploying to AWS with enhanced security:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - AWS account with appropriate permissions
   - Configured AWS CLI credentials
   - Terraform installed

2. **Database Migration**
   - Run the provided PostgreSQL migration script
   ```
   ./scripts/postgres-setup.sh
   ```

3. **Terraform Deployment**
   - Initialize Terraform
   ```
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```
   - Apply the configuration
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Configuration**
   - Update environment variables with AWS resource values
   - Configure CORS settings for API Gateway
   - Set up proper domain and certificate configuration

5. **Verification**
   - Test authentication flow
