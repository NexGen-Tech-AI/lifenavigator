# Security Implementation Status Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the security features implemented in the LifeNavigator codebase. The system demonstrates a mature security architecture with strong encryption, authentication, and monitoring capabilities. However, several areas require attention before production deployment.

## 1. Encryption Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Field-Level Encryption
- **Status**: Fully Implemented

  - Automatic encryption/decryption via Prisma middleware
  - Envelope encryption support with Data Encryption Keys (DEK)
  - Encrypted fields include:
    - User metadata
    - OAuth tokens (access_token, refresh_token, id_token)
    - Integration credentials
    - Salary information
    - Email content
    - Health records (blood type, allergies, medications)
    - Tax information

#### Database Encryption

- **Implementation**:
  - Database schema supports TOTP, SMS, and Email MFA
  - MFA settings stored encrypted
  - Backup codes support

### ⚠️ Pending Features
- MFA UI implementation
- MFA challenge/verification endpoints
- Recovery code generation UI

## 6. Secret Management

### ✅ Completed Features

- **Status**: Environment-based configuration

  - Comprehensive env.example file
  - Separate keys for:
    - Encryption (master key, salt)
    - Authentication (NextAuth secret)
    - Service integrations
    - Internal API communication

### ⚠️ Recommendations

- Implement AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for production
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use different keys per environment

## 7. API Security Measures

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Rate Limiting
