# Security Implementation Status Report
## Current State vs Advanced Security Architecture Goals

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED SECURITY FEATURES

#### 1. Encryption Architecture (70% Complete)
**‚úÖ Implemented:**
- Application layer: AES-256-GCM for OAuth tokens, financial data, health records
- Database layer: Field-level encryption via Prisma middleware
- Envelope encryption with Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)
- Automatic encryption/decryption for sensitive fields

**‚ùå Still Needed:**
- Transit layer: TLS 1.3 configuration (currently relying on Vercel defaults)
- Certificate pinning for mobile (no mobile app yet)
- Secret rotation: Manual process, need automated 90-day rotation
- Integration with AWS KMS or Supabase Vault for production

#### 2. Row Level Security (100% Complete)
**‚úÖ Fully Implemented in Supabase migrations:**
```sql
-- All tables have RLS enabled and policies defined
- users: Users can only see/modify their own profile
- financial_accounts: Users access only their accounts
- transactions: Users see only their transactions
- plaid_items: Users manage only their connections
- documents: Users access only their documents
- integrations: Users see only their integrations
- appointments: Users manage only their appointments
```

#### 3. Audit Logging (90% Complete)
**‚úÖ Implemented:**
- Comprehensive security_audit_logs table
- Tracks all authentication events
- IP address and user agent logging
- 90-day automatic retention
- Security report generation

**‚ùå Missing:**
- Real-time alerting on suspicious activity
- Integration with SIEM
- Automated anomaly detection

#### 4. Authentication Security (85% Complete)
**‚úÖ Implemented:**
- JWT with rotation (7-day access, 30-day refresh)
- Account lockout (5 attempts = 15-min lockout)
- CSRF protection
- Session management with device tracking
- Password strength requirements

**‚ùå Missing:**
- MFA UI implementation (backend ready)
- Passwordless authentication option
- Risk-based authentication

### ‚ùå PENDING SECURITY FEATURES

#### 1. Vault Implementation (0% Complete)
**Current State:** Using environment variables
**Needed:**
- HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager setup
- Dynamic secret generation
- Audit logging for secret access
- Disaster recovery procedures

#### 2. Zero-Trust Security Model (20% Complete)
**‚úÖ Partial Implementation:**
- Service-to-service authentication with HMAC
- Time-bound request validation

**‚ùå Needed:**
- Service mesh with mTLS
- OIDC tokens with 15-minute expiry
- Network segmentation per integration
- Service account privilege management

#### 3. Advanced API Security (60% Complete)
**‚úÖ Implemented:**
- Rate limiting (basic)
- CORS configuration
- Cross-service authentication

**‚ùå Needed:**
- WAF integration
- DDoS protection
- API versioning strategy
- Request signing for critical operations

### üö® CRITICAL GAPS FOR PRODUCTION

1. **Security Headers** - Not configured
   ```typescript
   // Need to implement:
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - Strict-Transport-Security
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - Referrer-Policy
   ```

2. **Input Validation** - Limited implementation
   - Need comprehensive Zod schemas
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection

3. **Monitoring & Alerting** - Basic only
   - Need real-time security monitoring
   - Automated incident response
   - Security metrics dashboard

### üìä SECURITY READINESS SCORE

| Component | Status | Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Encryption | Partial | 70% |
| Authentication | Strong | 85% |
| Authorization (RLS) | Complete | 100% |
| Audit Logging | Strong | 90% |
| API Security | Moderate | 60% |
| Infrastructure Security | Weak | 30% |
| **Overall Readiness** | **Moderate** | **72%** |

### üéØ PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR THIS WEEK

#### Day 1-2: Core Security Infrastructure
1. **Implement Supabase Vault**
   ```sql
   -- Enable Vault extension
   CREATE EXTENSION vault;
   
   -- Create encryption keys
   SELECT vault.create_secret('oauth_tokens_key');
   SELECT vault.create_secret('pii_data_key');
   ```

2. **Configure Security Headers**
   ```typescript
   // middleware.ts additions needed
   const securityHeaders = {
     'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000',
     'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
     'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
     'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
     'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'..."
   }
   ```

3. **Set up WAF Rules**
   - Configure Vercel Shield
   - Enable DDoS protection
   - Set up rate limiting per user

#### Day 3: Complete MFA Implementation
1. Finish MFA UI components
2. Test TOTP flow
3. Implement backup codes
4. Add WebAuthn support

#### Day 4-5: Production Hardening
1. Implement automated secret rotation
2. Set up security monitoring dashboard
3. Configure SIEM integration
4. Create incident response runbooks

### üìà INTEGRATION READINESS ASSESSMENT

**Can we safely add integrations this week?**
- ‚úÖ **YES for development/testing** - Core security is solid
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NO for production** - Need to complete critical gaps first

**Safe to integrate now:**
- Google Calendar/Gmail (OAuth tokens encrypted)
- Plaid (tokens encrypted, webhooks secured)
- Document scanning (files encrypted)

**Wait until security hardening:**
- Healthcare provider APIs (need HIPAA compliance)
- Direct bank connections (need enhanced monitoring)
- Insurance integrations (need data governance)
