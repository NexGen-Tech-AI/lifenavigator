   ```

---

## 4. VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT

### Vulnerability Scanning Program

#### Automated Scanning:
1. **Production Infrastructure**:
   - **Daily**: Dependency scanning (Dependabot)
   - **Weekly**: Infrastructure vulnerability scans
   - **Monthly**: Penetration testing (automated)
   - **Quarterly**: Manual penetration testing

2. **Employee Devices**:
   - **Weekly**: OS and software vulnerability scans
   - **Real-time**: Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
   - **Monthly**: Compliance checks

#### Patch Management:
```yaml
Patch Timeline SLA:
- Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0): 24 hours
- High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): 72 hours
- Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): 7 days
- Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9): 30 days
```

#### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Advanced Security**: Code scanning
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability detection
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application scanning

---

## 5. ENDPOINT PROTECTION

### Endpoint Security Implementation

#### Production Servers (Immutable):
- **Serverless Architecture**: No persistent server instances
- **Container Scanning**: All Docker images scanned before deployment
- **Runtime Protection**: Falco for anomaly detection
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Servers rebuilt on each deployment

#### Employee Devices:
1. **Antivirus/Anti-malware**:
   - CrowdStrike Falcon (EDR + Next-Gen AV)
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Automatic quarantine

2. **Additional Controls**:
   - Full disk encryption (BitLocker/FileVault)
   - Host-based firewall enabled
   - Application whitelisting
   - USB device control

#### Security Stack per Endpoint:
```
Employee Laptop Security:
├── OS: Auto-updates enabled
├── EDR: CrowdStrike Falcon
├── Encryption: Full disk (AES-256)
├── VPN: Required for sensitive operations
├── MFA: Hardware keys (YubiKey)
└── DLP: Endpoint data loss prevention
```

---

## 6. BYOD POLICY

### Bring Your Own Device Management

**Current Policy**: LIMITED BYOD with strict controls

#### Allowed BYOD Scenarios:
1. **Email Access Only**: Via secured web portal
2. **Emergency On-Call**: With isolated VDI access
3. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Personal phones for MFA apps

#### BYOD Security Requirements:
- Device must be registered with IT
- MDM (Mobile Device Management) enrollment required
- Automatic lock after 5 minutes
- Remote wipe capability enabled
- No local storage of company data
- Encrypted communication only

#### Prohibited on Personal Devices:
- Direct database access
- Source code repositories
- Customer data access
- Financial data processing

---

## 7. ACCESS CONTROLS

### Production Access Control Framework

#### Access Control Model:
```
Zero Trust Architecture:
├── Principle of Least Privilege
├── Just-In-Time (JIT) Access
├── Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
└── Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
```

#### Implementation:
1. **Identity Verification**:
   - All access requires authentication
   - Service accounts use non-human identity tokens
   - Regular access reviews (monthly)

2. **Access Request Process**:
   - Manager approval required
   - Time-limited access grants
   - Automatic de-provisioning
   - Full audit trail

3. **Production Access Tiers**:
   ```
   Tier 1 (Read-Only): Monitoring and logs
   Tier 2 (Limited Write): Specific service updates
   Tier 3 (Full Access): Emergency response only
   ```

4. **Segregation of Duties**:
   - Development and production access separated
   - No single person can deploy and approve
   - Financial data access requires dual approval

---

## 8. MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

### Strong Authentication Implementation

#### Current MFA Deployment:
1. **Critical Systems (100% Coverage)**:
   - Production environment access
   - Administrative portals
   - Financial data access
   - Source code repositories
   - Cloud provider consoles

2. **MFA Methods Supported**:
   ```
   Primary: Hardware Security Keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
   ├── YubiKey 5 Series (required for admins)
   └── Backup: TOTP via enterprise app
   
   Not Allowed:
   ├── SMS (phishing risk)
   └── Email codes (account takeover risk)
   ```

3. **Additional Authentication Controls**:
   - Passwordless authentication for critical systems
   - Certificate-based authentication for service accounts
   - Risk-based authentication (location, device, behavior)
   - Session timeout after 12 hours

#### Implementation Timeline:
- **Current**: 100% MFA for production access
- **Next 30 days**: 100% MFA for all employee accounts
- **Next 90 days**: Passwordless rollout
