## CHANGE CONTROLS

### 9. Code Release Process
**Response: YES** - We have a defined process for building and releasing code changes to production assets.

**Implementation:**
- **Version Control**: All code managed in Git with protected main branch
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds via GitHub Actions
- **Release Process**:
  1. Feature branches created from main
  2. Pull request required for all changes
  3. Automated build and test execution
  4. Manual approval required
  5. Automated deployment to staging
  6. Production deployment requires additional approval
  7. Automated rollback capability

```yaml
Release Pipeline:
├── Development Branch
├── Automated Tests (Unit, Integration, E2E)
├── Code Quality Checks (ESLint, TypeScript)
├── Security Scanning (Snyk, Dependabot)
├── Staging Deployment
├── Manual QA Verification
├── Production Approval Gate
└── Production Deployment with Monitoring
```

### 10. Code Testing Enforcement
**Response: YES** - We logically enforce the testing of code changes before deployment.

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Minimum 80% code coverage** enforced via CI
- **Test Types Required**:
  - Unit tests for all business logic
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - E2E tests for critical user flows
  - Security tests for authentication/authorization
- **Automated Test Gates**: Deployment blocked if tests fail
- **Performance Testing**: Load tests for API endpoints

### 11. Code Review and Approval
**Response: YES** - We logically enforce review and approval of code changes.

**Review Process:**
- **Mandatory PR Reviews**: At least 2 approvals required
- **Automated Checks**:
  - No merge without passing tests

- **Review Checklist**:
  - Security implications reviewed
  - Performance impact assessed
  - Documentation updated
  - Breaking changes identified
