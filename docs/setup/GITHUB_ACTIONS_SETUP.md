# GitHub Actions Setup for Vercel Deployment

This guide explains how to set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your LifeNavigator app to Vercel.

## Required Secrets for GitHub Actions

To enable automatic deployments to Vercel, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

### Step 1: Get Vercel Credentials

1. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Login to Vercel: `vercel login`
3. Link your project: `vercel link` (if already deployed once to Vercel)
4. Get your tokens by running:
   ```bash
   vercel project ls
   # Note the project ID
   
   vercel whoami
   # Note the team ID (or user ID if not in a team)
   ```
5. Generate a Vercel token:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/account/tokens
   - Create a new token with a description like "GitHub Actions"
   - Copy the token

### Step 2: Add Secrets to GitHub Repository

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add the following secrets:

   | Name | Value |
   |------|-------|
   | `VERCEL_TOKEN` | The token you created in Vercel |
   | `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Your team ID (or user ID) from `vercel whoami` |
   | `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Your project ID from `vercel project ls` |

### Step 3: Configure Additional Environment Variables (Optional)

If you need specific environment variables for your production deployment, add them in:

1. The Vercel dashboard under your project settings
2. Or as GitHub repository secrets with a prefix like `VERCEL_ENV_` if you want to pass them through the workflow

## The GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow in `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml` performs these steps:

1. **For all PRs and pushes to main:**
   - Runs linting and type checking
   - Executes tests to ensure quality

2. **For Pull Requests:**
   - Deploys a preview environment to Vercel
   - Adds a comment to the PR with the deployment URL

3. **For Pushes to main:**
   - Deploys to the production environment on Vercel

## Manual Deployments

You can also trigger a manual deployment:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select the "Deploy to Vercel" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose the branch to deploy
5. Click "Run workflow" button

## Verifying the Setup

To verify your GitHub Actions setup is working correctly:

1. Make a small change to your codebase
2. Create a pull request
3. Check that the workflow runs and deploys a preview
4. Merge the PR to main and verify the production deployment

## Troubleshooting

If deployments fail, check:

1. **GitHub Actions Log:** Look for specific error messages
2. **Vercel Settings:** Ensure your project is correctly configured in Vercel
3. **Secrets:** Verify all required secrets are set correctly
4. **Vercel Dashboard:** Check for deployment issues on the Vercel side

## Security Notes

- Store sensitive environment variables in Vercel's environment variables section
- GitHub repository secrets are encrypted and only exposed during workflow runs
- Regularly rotate your Vercel tokens
