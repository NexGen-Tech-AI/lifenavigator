- **Redundancy**: Failover testing, load balancing verification

### 3. Processing Integrity (PI1.0)
- **Data Accuracy**: Input validation, calculation verification
- **Completeness**: Transaction monitoring, reconciliation
- **Timeliness**: Processing SLA enforcement
- **Authorization**: Approval workflows, audit trails

### 4. Confidentiality (C1.0)
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access, need-to-know enforcement
- **Data Retention**: Automated disposal, secure deletion
- **Third-Party Management**: NDAs, data processing agreements

### 5. Privacy (P1.0)
- **Notice & Consent**: Privacy policy, consent management

## Compliance Thresholds

| Criteria | Required Score | Critical Controls |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Security | ≥ 95% | Authentication, Encryption, Access Control |
| Availability | ≥ 99% | Uptime, Backup, DR |
| Processing Integrity | ≥ 98% | Validation, Accuracy |
| Confidentiality | ≥ 95% | Encryption, Access |
| Privacy | ≥ 90% | Consent, Rights |

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: SOC 2 Compliance Check
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Daily
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  soc2-compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm run test:soc2
      - run: npm run soc2:report
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: soc2-report
          path: compliance-reports/
```

### Pre-deployment Checks
```bash
# Run before production deployment
npm run soc2:pre-deploy

# Validates:
# - All security controls active
# - No critical findings
# - Compliance score ≥ 90%
# - Audit logging enabled
```

## Remediation Process

### 1. Finding Classification
- **Critical**: Immediate action required (< 24 hours)
- **High**: Action within 7 days
- **Medium**: Action within 30 days
- **Low**: Next release cycle

### 2. Remediation Workflow
1. Automated ticket creation
2. Assignment to responsible team
3. Fix implementation
4. Verification testing
5. Evidence collection
6. Report update

### 3. Exception Process
- Business justification required
- Risk assessment
- Compensating controls
- Executive approval
- Periodic review

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Dashboards
- Compliance score trends
- Control effectiveness
- Finding status
- Remediation progress

### Alerts Configuration
```javascript
// Critical alerts
- Compliance score < 90%
- Critical finding detected
- Control failure
- Audit trail gap

// Warning alerts
- Score decline > 5%
- High findings > 3
- Approaching SLA breach
```
