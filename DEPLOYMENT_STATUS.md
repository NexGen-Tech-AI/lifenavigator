# LifeNavigator Deployment Status

## Current Status

We have successfully:

1. ✅ **Fixed the database configuration**: Updated the schema to use Prisma Accelerate and connection pooling
2. ✅ **Deployed the application**: Successfully deployed to Vercel at https://lifenavigator-ahdqkzqhf-riffe007s-projects.vercel.app
3. ✅ **Added database setup utilities**: Created scripts to initialize the database schema

## Final Steps

The application is deployed, but there are a few final steps to complete:

1. **Set environment variables in Vercel**:
   - Add `USE_MOCK_DB=true` to allow the application to work without a real database initially
   - Ensure proper PostgreSQL connection strings are set

2. **Initialize the database**:
   - Use the `scripts/simple-migration.js` to initialize the database schema
   - Create a demo user account

3. **Verify functionality**:
   - Test logging in with demo@example.com / password
   - Verify application features are working correctly

## How to Complete Setup

### Option 1: Use Mock Database (Recommended for testing)

1. In the Vercel project settings, add:
   - `USE_MOCK_DB=true`

2. Deploy the application:
   ```
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```

3. The application will use an in-memory database with the demo account:
   - Email: demo@example.com
   - Password: password

### Option 2: Use Real PostgreSQL Database

1. Create a PostgreSQL database in Vercel:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard → LifeNavigator project
   - Click "Storage" → "Connect Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Follow the setup instructions

2. Set required environment variables in Vercel:
   - `USE_MOCK_DB=false`
   - `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` (should be auto-filled by Vercel)
   - `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` (should be auto-filled by Vercel)

3. Run the database migration:
   ```
   node scripts/simple-migration.js
   ```

4. Deploy the application:
   ```
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```

## Current Application URL

The latest successful deployment is at:
https://lifenavigator-ahdqkzqhf-riffe007s-projects.vercel.app

You can log in with:
- Email: demo@example.com
- Password: password

## Troubleshooting

If login doesn't work:
1. Check that `USE_MOCK_DB=true` is set in Vercel environment
2. Verify database connection settings if using a real database
3. Try manually running the migration script:
   ```
   node scripts/simple-migration.js
   ```
