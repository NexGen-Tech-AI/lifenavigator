# Security Improvements for LifeNavigator

## Implemented Security Enhancements

### 1. Authentication Improvements
- ✅ Fixed hardcoded password validation in NextAuth.ts
- ✅ Implemented proper bcrypt password comparison
- ✅ Added strong password requirements (12+ chars with complexity)
- ✅ Implemented MFA with TOTP and recovery codes
- ✅ Added account lockout mechanism (5 attempts, 15 minute lockout)
- ✅ Shortened session token lifetime (8 hours instead of 30 days)
- ✅ Configured secure cookies (HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite)

### 2. API Route Security
- ✅ Implemented centralized session validation with withAuth middleware
- ✅ Created route helpers for consistent security application
- ✅ Added session hijacking detection via activity monitoring
- ✅ Implemented JWT token verification
- ✅ Added role-based and permission-based access control framework
- ✅ Added method restriction to API endpoints

### 3. CSRF Protection
- ✅ Implemented double-submit cookie pattern for CSRF protection
- ✅ Added CSRF validation in middleware for mutation endpoints
- ✅ Created context provider for client-side CSRF token access

- ⏳ Develop user-facing security documentation

## Next Steps Priority

1. Complete API route security updates using the created tools
2. Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
3. Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production database
4. Encrypt sensitive data in the database
5. Remove hardcoded secrets and implement secure key management
6. Set up comprehensive security monitoring and alerting
7. Create security documentation for developers and users
